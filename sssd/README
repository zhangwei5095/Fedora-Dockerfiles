=====================
SSSD Atomic container
=====================

Configure:

If SSSD has already been configured on the Atomic Host, for example
the host was IPA-enrolled, running

   # atomic install sssd --migrate

will override the sssd.service definition to start the service in
container via atomic. Existing configuration and data will be re-used.

If SSSD hasn't been configured yet, run

   # atomic install sssd [ options ]

The options will be passed to ipa-client-install, so for example

   # atomic install sssd --password the-otp-password

will attempt to IPA-enroll the machine with the one-time password.

If the options start with word realm, realm (typically realm join)
will be used instead of ipa-client-install:

   # atomic install sssd realm join [ realm join's options ]

Options to atomic install can also be specified in the following files
on the host:

   /etc/sssd/ipa-client-install-options - parameters to ipa-client-install
   /etc/sssd/realm-join-options - parameters to realm join
   /etc/sssd/realm-join-password - file with password for realm join

When SSSD and dependent packages are not installed on the host, at least
the following libraries need to be present there:

   /usr/lib64/libnss_sss.so.2
   /usr/lib64/sssd/modules/sssd_krb5_localauth_plugin.so
   /usr/lib64/libsss_sudo.so
   /usr/lib64/security/pam_sss.so
   /usr/lib64/security/pam_oddjob_mkhomedir.so (for realm join setup)

Run:

On the Atomic Host, run

   # atomic run sssd

or

   # systemctl start sssd.service

Then for example ssh access to the Atomic Host machine with Kerberos
single sign-on will work.

Uninstall:

   # atomic uninstall sssd
